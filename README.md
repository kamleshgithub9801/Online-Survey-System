Online Survey System

The idea of this project is to create a core java
project that can accumulate the viewpoint of a
targeted audience of a survey through the Internet.
Based on that, the app can send the targeted
audiences promotional emails and can launch
online surveys. Any business can make use of this
type of software to assemble feedback regarding
the services or products they offer. We can build
such functionality so that only registered
customers can cast their responses. The main
attributes of the app should be:

1.The apps are programmed in a way that they
should be compatible with various databases like
SQL and NoSQL.
2.Customers can submit their reactions
anonymously.
3.Should be installed at a doable cost.
